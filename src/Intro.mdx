# Welcome to Dhashdev Component Library

Welcome to dhashdev component library, a collection of reusable UI components built with design code principles. Our library aims to provide developers with a set of consistent, customizable, and easy-to-use components to streamline the development process and ensure a cohesive user experience across applications. The components are based on [Design+Code](https://designcode.io/), a extensible UI component build by [Meng to](https://twitter.com/MengTo) as [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/uyBV0KLTueIe9Tu2hxZfRH/Design-System?type=design&node-id=6-2&mode=design) Components.

## What is Design Code?

Design code is the practice of using design systems to bridge the gap between design and development. It involves translating design elements, such as colors, typography, spacing, and layout, into reusable code components. By following design code principles, developers can maintain consistency in UI elements, reduce redundancy in code, and accelerate the development process.

## About Our Library

Our component library is built on top of popular frameworks like React and styled-components, making it easy to integrate into your projects. Each component is meticulously crafted with attention to detail, accessibility, and performance in mind.

## Features

- **Reusable Components**: Our library includes a variety of reusable components such as buttons, inputs, cards, and more, allowing you to quickly build interfaces without reinventing the wheel.
- **Customizable Styles**: Components are highly customizable, with support for theming, custom styles, and props to adapt to your project's specific needs.
- **Documentation and Examples**: Comprehensive documentation and live examples are provided for each component, making it easy to understand how to use and customize them in your projects.
- **Responsive Design**: Components are designed to be responsive, ensuring they look and function seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.
