## Contribution

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! To maintain a collaborative and productive environment, please adhere to the following guidelines when contributing:

1. Reporting Issues: If you encounter any bugs, inconsistencies, or have suggestions for improvements, please create an issue on GitHub. Clearly describe the problem or suggestion, along with steps to reproduce if applicable.

2. Submitting Pull Requests: Before starting work on a new feature or fix, please open an issue to discuss the proposed changes. This helps ensure that your contribution aligns with the project goals and prevents duplicate efforts.

3. Branching Strategy: We follow a Git branching strategy to organize our work. Please adhere to the following naming conventions when creating branches:

   - For working on a particular component and its feature: `component/feature/feature-name`
   - For building a new component: `component/component-name`
   - For fixing a bug or improving an existing feature: `bug/fix/bug-name`

4. Coding Standards:Follow the coding standards and style guidelines established in the project. Ensure your code is well-documented and follows best practices to maintain readability and consistency.

5. Testing: Write tests for any new features or fixes you contribute. Ensure existing tests pass and write additional tests as necessary to cover edge cases. Test should be written for all components inside the respective component directory in folder named `__tests__`, follow the naming convention.

6. Commit Messages: Write clear and descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of each change. Use present-tense verbs and be concise but informative. Before commiting husky will automatically format, lint and test the code, please respect those pre-commit guidelines and make sure it passes.

## Git Branching Rules

We use Git branches to manage our development workflow. Here are some rules to follow when creating and managing branches:

**Main Branch**: The main branch represents the latest stable version of the project and is also the production branch. Avoid committing directly to this branch.

**Development Branch**: `development` is the development branch for the project. All new features and bug fixes should be developed against this branch, and then merged into the main branch. But no direct pull request should be made to main branch.

**Feature Branches**: When working on a new feature or improvement, create a feature branch off the main branch. Name the branch according to the feature you're working on, following the format `component/feature/feature-name`.

**Component Branches**: If you're building a new component, create a component branch off the main branch. Name the branch according to the component you're building, following the format `component/component-name`.

**Pull Requests**: When your work is complete, submit a pull request from your feature or component branch to the main branch. Ensure the pull request includes a clear description of the changes and any related issues it addresses.

By following these guidelines and branching rules, we can collaborate effectively and maintain a high-quality codebase. Thank you for your contributions!
